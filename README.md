#### Used libraries
The main python library used in this case is [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/), which is the Python API for Apache Spark. It enables you to perform real-time, large-scale data processing in a distributed environment using Python. It also provides a PySpark shell for interactively analyzing your data.\

#### Project overview
Generally this project is divided into two main analysis parts. The first one related to three parameters: Age, Dender of user types of different bike riders, and the second one related to different stations locations. And in all of these points we will be trying to derive some key insights from where the company could increase its overall revenues
